# SolvingProblems
In this file I show how I solved the MAX Cut, TSP, and a Room Assignment problem. I solved MAX Cut and TSP for my understanding, and then used this knowledge to solve a problem that occurs at my unversity. The problem being assiging which room to which class. Based on the number of students per class, and chairs per room. Where the goal is to waste the least amount of chairs.

# SolvingProposedSolution
Just as the name implies, here I try to manually solve a QUBO of a proposed set of binary values.

# LogicalCircuits
I wondered whether if we can run classical algorithms on an annealer. To do so I tried building logical gates that are solved by the annealer. It is important to note that the current algorithm does not output the correct result always. I am close to making this work.

# EstimatingOffset
Adding a suitable offset to your QUBO can play a major role in the success of the annealing process. This algorithm uses a centralised offset approach to calculate a suitable offset for a QUBO.
